## Todo:
* AI
  * Evaluation function - To evaluate a given position and find how favourable it is to white or black
  * Loop through all possible moves and use evaluation function to find the best move
  * Implement alpha beta pruning to make the algorithm faster
* Timers
* More GUI to display information
* Changes to GUI to display previous moves, display differently the square of a capture move.
* GUI resolution and scaling
